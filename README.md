# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on the similarity of their descriptions.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Lemmatization** to analyze and compare movie plots.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Text preprocessing using **tokenization** and **lemmatization**  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**  
- Model evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score**  
- Achieved an impressive **88% accuracy** on the test dataset  
- Provides movie recommendations based on content similarity  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK / spaCy** (for text preprocessing)
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualizations)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Converted text to lowercase  
2. Removed punctuation, digits, and special characters  
3. Removed stopwords  
4. Applied **lemmatization** to normalize words  
5. Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features  

## 📈 Model Evaluation
| Metric | Score |
|:-------|:------:|
| Accuracy | 88% |
| Precision | High |
| F1-Score | High |
